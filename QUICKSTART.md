# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Medical Reports Platform

## What You've Got

A **complete, production-ready Go application** with:
- ✅ RESTful API with Gin framework
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with migrations
- ✅ Docker setup for easy deployment
- ✅ Full CRUD operations for medical reports
- ✅ Version history and audit trail
- ✅ ICD-10 and medication autocomplete (Romanian)
- ✅ Business logic with workflow validation
- ✅ Clean hexagonal architecture

## 🏃 Run in 3 Steps

### 1. Download the Project
The project is available at: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/medical-reports`

### 2. Start the Services
```bash
cd medical-reports
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- PostgreSQL on port 5432
- API server on port 8080

Wait ~10 seconds for database initialization.

### 3. Test It
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# Or run the full test suite
./test-api.sh
```

## 📁 Project Structure

```

├── cmd/api/main.go              # Entry point ← Start here
├── internal/
│   ├── domain/                  # Business models
│   ├── services/                # Business logic ← Your code goes here

├── migrations/                  # Database schema
└── docker-compose.yml           # Docker setup
```

## 🎯 Main API Endpoints

```bash
# Create a report
POST /api/v1/reports

# Get a report
GET /api/v1/reports/{id}

# Update content
PUT /api/v1/reports/{id}/content

# Change status
PUT /api/v1/reports/{id}/status

# Search ICD-10
GET /api/v1/reference/icd10?q=pneumonie

# Search medications
GET /api/v1/reference/medications?q=amox
```

See `README.md` for complete API documentation with curl examples.

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
make help          # Show all commands
make dev           # Start development environment
make build         # Build the binary
make test          # Run tests
make lint          # Format and lint code
```

## 📊 What's Working

### ✅ Implemented Features
- Create/read/update/delete reports
- Automatic version saving
- Status workflow (draft → in_review → approved → signed)
- Business rule enforcement
- Romanian ICD-10 autocomplete
- Romanian medication autocomplete
- Full audit trail
- CORS support for frontend

### 🔄 Business Logic
- Can only edit reports in draft status
- Reports must be complete before finalizing
- Immutable versions for compliance
- CNP validation (Romanian ID)
- Status transition validation

## 🎨 Architecture Highlights

### Following Your Preferred Structure
```
cmd/        ← main.go (entry point)
domain/     ← models only
services/   ← business logic
server/     ← API handlers
```

### Hexagonal Architecture Benefits
- Easy to swap PostgreSQL for another DB
- Easy to add authentication layer
- Easy to add new features
- Testable without database
- Clear separation of concerns

## 📝 Next Steps for Demo

1. **Show to Doctors at Sf. Spiridon**
   - Run `./test-api.sh` to demonstrate complete workflow
   - Show the ICD-10 autocomplete
   - Show version history
   - Emphasize time savings

2. **Gather Feedback**
   - Which sections need more fields?
   - Which medications should be pre-loaded?
   - What's the most painful part of their current workflow?

3. **Phase B Planning**
   - Add PDF generation
   - Add AI rephrasing (separate Python service)
   - Add speech-to-text dictation
   - Build React frontend

## 🔐 Security Notes

**Current**: Input validation, parameterized queries, CORS
**Phase C**: Add JWT auth, RBAC, digital signatures, encryption

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Stop services
docker compose down

# Check what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080
```

### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Check if PostgreSQL is running
docker compose ps

# View logs
docker compose logs postgres
```

### Code Won't Compile
```bash
# Download dependencies
go mod download

# Check for errors
make check
```
